He started as a business major, but then switched to biology and chemistry to become premed. After finishing medical school, he then completed a surgical internship at the University of Heidelberg in Germany before starting his surgical residency at the New England Medical Center in Boston. It is there that he met his future wife (also a licensed physician).

Ipson left his residency to attend USCâ€™s Peter Stark Producing Program. He graduated having directed two thesis projects, Peeping Tom and The First Vampire, and produced the thesis project Playback. Peeping Tom took grand prize at 16 short film festivals. The First Vampire was not shown on festival circuits in hopes of releasing it as a DVD bonus feature someday. The short version won a production grant in 2001 for its use of science from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
